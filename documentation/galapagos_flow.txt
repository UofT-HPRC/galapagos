===========================
DEFINITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
===========================

In this file, $GALAPDIR will refer to the root directory of the Galapagos 
repository. (Note: this is not an environment variable used by Galapagos; it is 
a placeholder for you to replace yourself)

$BOARD will refer to the name of the currently targeted board. 

All commands are assumed to be run from inside $GALAPDIR (unless otherwise 
stated).

A "kernel" means a single user module in the Galapagos cluster, analogous to a 
Rank in MPI.


========
OVERVIEW
========

The following numbered list explains the brief details of using Galapagos. More 
details are provided in the later sections of this document. There is also a 
quick blurb on writing kernels in HLS.

When first installing Galapagos, 

    1) Run `$GALAPDIR/build.sh` and answer all its questions

For each board you wish to use,

    2) Use `galapagos_update_board <your board name>` to select the board, and 
    
    3) Run `make middleware` from inside $GALAPDIR

To create a Galapagos project,

    4) Package kernels as IPs and place them in $GALAPDIR/hlsBuild/$BOARD/ip, 
       where $BOARD is the board that the IP is targeted for. 
       -> Use this directory even if your kernel is not written in HLS
    
    5) Write a logical file and a mapping file (details provided below)
    
    6) Set the LOGICALFILE and MAPFILE environment variables to be the full 
       path of your logical file and mapping file (repsectively). Also set the 
       PROJECTNAME environment variable to be the desired project name
    
    7) Run `make middleware` from inside $GALAPDIR

    8) If there were no errors, Galapagos will have created a directory called 
       $GALAPDIR/projects/$PROJECTNAME which contains a number of TCL scripts 
       and a bash script called createCluster.sh. Simply run this shell script 
       and wait for Vivado to produce your bitstream(s).
       

===============================
WHEN FIRST INSTALLING GALAPAGOS
===============================

For the time being, Galapagos works by reading a number of environment 
variables. Run

    $ cd $GALAPDIR
    $ source build.sh

This will bring up a snazzy menu. Answer its questions. Don't worry about 
making a mistake; you can always try this again if it doesn't work.

Once you have finished answering the questions, Galapgos will have created a 
new file in your home folder. You can take a look at it:

    $ less ~/.galapagos

This file simply sets Galapagos's environment variables using the answers you 
provided earlier. It also defines two bash shell functions: 
galapagos-update-board and galapagos-update-version. The first function allows 
you ask Galapagos to target a different board without re-running build.sh, and 
the second lets you select a different Vivado version.

Finally, note that build.sh adds a line to your .bashrc:

    $ less ~/.bashrc

This ensures that .galapagos is called whenever you open a new bash shell. 


==============================
FOR EACH BOARD YOU PLAN TO USE
==============================
    
Galapagos uses a number of custom IP cores written in HLS. These must be 
synthesized and packaged as IPs before you can start making your own projects.

Run the following from inside $GALAPDIR:

    $ galapagos-update-board <your board name>
    $ make hlsmiddleware

Currently, Galapagos supports the following choices for <your board name>:

    - zynq-p2
    - zedboard
    - sidewinder
    - adm-8k5
    - adm-8k5-debug


======================
WRITING KERNELS IN HLS
======================

Include the header file in $GALAPDIR/middleware/include/galapagos_packet.h

The following is a skeleton of an HLS Galapagos kernel:
