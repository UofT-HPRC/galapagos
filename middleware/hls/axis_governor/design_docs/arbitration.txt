===================================================
HOW DOES THE ARBITRATION WORK IN THE AXIS GOVERNOR?
===================================================

Suppose I have an AXI Stream between two points:

  +-----------+                                     +-----------+
  |        vld|------------------------------------>|vld        |
  |           |                                     |           |
  | Alex      |                                     |  Brittany |
  |           |                                     |           |
  |        rdy|<------------------------------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+                                     +-----------+
  

(Note: "Alice and Bob" have been used so often that I have named my two parties 
differently)

We will consider how we can add some logic to allow:
    - Pausing transmission
    - Forcing flits to be dropped
    - Injecting flits
    - Logging flits

Our technique will be to do each of features separately, then to combine them. 
After that, I will present the technique I used to verify that we (probably) 
didn't miss any corner cases.

=======
PAUSING
=======

We will add an input signal which stops transmission if it is high, and has no 
effect if it is low:

                             pause
                               +
                               |   __
  +-----------+                +-o|  \              +-----------+
  |        vld|----------------|--|__/------------->|vld        |
  |           |                |                    |           |
  | Alex      |           __   |                    |  Brittany |
  |           |          /  |o-+                    |           |
  |        rdy|<---------\__|-----------------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+                                     +-----------+

(These are AND gates)

If pause is low, Brittany.vld = Alex.vld and Alex.rdy = Brittany.rdy. However, 
if pause is high, Alex.rdy is low and Brittany.vld is low, meaning that neither 
will ever see a flit go by.


========
DROPPING
========

Now we will add an input which causes Alex to think Brittany is always ready, 
but Brittany thinks Alex is never valid (in other words, flits from Alex will 
be dropped):


                              drop
                               +
                               |   __
  +-----------+                +-o|  \              +-----------+
  |        vld|----------------|--|__/------------->|vld        |
  |           |                |                    |           |
  | Alex      |            ___ |                    |  Brittany |
  |           |           /  /-+                    |           |
  |        rdy|<----------\__\----------------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+                                     +-----------+

(The top gate is an AND and the bottom is an OR)


=========
INJECTING
=========

This is a little more complicated. We'll add an injection input (as an AXI 
Stream master). If there is an injected flit we need to backpressure Alex, but 
we still want transmissions to continue otherwise:

                                ___
  +-----------+               +-\  \                +-----------+
  |        vld|---------------|-/__/--------------->|vld        |
  |           |               |                     |           |
  | Alex      |          __   |                     |  Brittany |
  |           |         /  |o-+                     |           |
  |        rdy|<--------\__|--|------+--------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+               |      |              +-----------+
                              |      |
                              |      v
                           +------------+
                           | vld    rdy |
                           |            |
                           |   Inject   |
                           |            |
                           +------------+

Suppose Inject.vld is low; then (Brittany.vld = Alex.vld) and (Alex.rdy = 
Brittany.rdy). This means that transmissions can continue if we're not 
injecting anything.

Suppose Inject.vld is high; then Alex.rdy is low (thus causing backpressure) 
and Brittany.vld is high (which is correct, since Inject.vld is high and is the 
source of flits for Brittany).


=======
LOGGING 
=======

NAÏVE METHOD
------------

This is the most complicated task. We will add a log output (as an AXI Stream 
slave). Alex must be backpressured if either Brittany or the logging output is 
not ready:

  +-----------+                                     +-----------+
  |        vld|---------------+-------------------->|vld        |
  |           |               |                     |           |
  | Alex      |               |  __                 |  Brittany |
  |           |               | /  |-+              |           |
  |        rdy|<----------------\__|-|--------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+               |      |              +-----------+
                              |      |
                              v      |
                           +------------+
                           | vld    rdy |
                           |            |
                           |     Log    |
                           |            |
                           +------------+

However, we run into trouble if we do this: if Alex is valid, then the logger 
or Brittany will record a flit whenever they are ready. However, they must both 
be ready before Alex will consider a flit to have been read.

In other words, flits are copied if exactly one of Brittany or the logging 
output is ready!


ELIMINATING INCORRECT FLIT COPIES
---------------------------------

To fix this, we should make sure that Brittany.vld and Log.vld are only high 
when a flit is read from master:


                     __
  +-----------+   +-|  \                            +-----------+
  |        vld|---|-|__/------+-------------------->|vld        |
  |           |   |           |                     |           |
  | Alex      |   |           |  __                 |  Brittany |
  |           |   |           | /  |-+              |           |
  |        rdy|<--+-------------\__|-|--------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+               |      |              +-----------+
                              |      |
                              v      |
                           +------------+
                           | vld    rdy |
                           |            |
                           |     Log    |
                           |            |
                           +------------+

This does techninically solve the problem, but we have now violated the AXI 
Stream specification! In the spec, it is legal for a slave to have a 
combinational path from its "valid" input to its "ready" output. By letting 
Brittany.vld = (Alex.vld && Alex.rdy) = (Alex.vld && Brittany.rdy && Log.rdy) 
we might make a combinational loop involving Brittany.vld and Brittany.rdy!

And by the way, this same problem also exists for the Log output.


FIXING COMBINATIONAL LOOPS
--------------------------

The idea is this: Log is only valid if Alex is valid and Brittany is ready. 
Likewise, Brittany is only valid if Alex is valid and the Log is ready. It's 
actually easier to understand this reasoning if we had, say, five slaves. The 
master should never send unless all five are ready, but each slave should never
receive unless the master is valid AND all the other slaves are ready.

The final circuit is as follows:

[TODO: UPDATE]
                                        __
  +-----------+                      +-|  \         +-----------+
  |        vld|--------------+-------|-|__/-------->|vld        |
  |           |              | /--+  |              |           |
  | Alex      |              ---  |  |              |  Brittany |
  |           |        __    \_/  |  |              |           |
  |        rdy|<------/  |----|---+--|--------------|rdy        |
  +-----------+       \__|----|------+              +-----------+
                              |      |
                              v      |
                           +------------+      +------------------+
                           | vld    rdy |      |  a b             |
                           |            |      |  | |             |
                           |     Log    |      |  ---             |
                           |            |      |  \_/  f = a AND b|
                           +------------+      |   |              |
                                               |   f              |
                                               +------------------+

This is much more subtle. If Log.rdy is low, then Alex.rdy is low and 
Brittany.vld is low; this backpressures Alex and makes sure Brittany doesn't 
read anything.

If Log.rdy is high, then Alex.rdy = Brittany.rdy and Brittany.vld = Alex.vld, 
which guarantees correct transmissions from Alex to Brittany. Furthermore, 
Log.vld = (Alex.vld && Alex.rdy), which ensures that the logger only logs flits 
that Alex transmitted (this is similar to a snooping interface).

If you're like me, at this point you're thinking "well, I guess that makes 
sense, but how do I know I didn't miss anything?". As far as I know, the only 
way to be sure is to do a truth table and inspect every single circumstance 
manually. See the section at the end of this document.


===================
PUTTING IT TOGETHER
===================

This section presents how I chose to combine all these techniques. There are 
actually several options, which could all be considered correct, though they 
have different "precedence"; for example, if "drop" has higher precedence than 
"pause", it means that flits from Alex will be dropped if both these signals 
are asserted. On the other hand, if "pause" has higher precence, Alex will be 
forcibly backpressured when both signals are asserted.

Here is a high-level view of the AXI Stream governor:

                pause       log        drop
                  |          |          |
                  v          v          v
  +-----------+ +---+ +-------------+ +---+ +-------------+ +-----------+
  |        vld|-| P |-|             |-| D |-|             |-|vld        |
  |           | | A | |   Logging   | | R | |  Injection  | |           |
  | Alex      | | U | | arbitration | | O | | arbitration | |  Brittany |
  |           | | S | |    logic    | | P | |    logic    | |           |
  |        rdy|-| E |-|             |-|   |-|             |-|rdy        |
  +-----------+ +---+ +-------------+ +---+ +-------------+ +-----------+
                         |      |              |       |
                         |      |              |       |
                      +------------+         +------------+
                      | vld    rdy |         | vld    rdy |
                      |            |         |            |
                      |     Log    |         |   Inject   |
                      |            |         |            |
                      +------------+         +------------+

The trick is to notice that each individual technique still looks like an AXI 
Stream after it has been applied, so we can literally chain them together. My 
choice was to let pause have highest precedence, and that injections should 
still be honoured even when drop is high. Furthermore, logs can still occur 
even if drop is high (and in fact, if drop is high, logs are not stopped even 
if Brittany.rdy is low).

The final circuit diagram is obtained by substituting in the individual 
circuits. For completeness, I have drawn it up; please see governor.png in this 
folder. It was generated by the excellent Logisim program using governor.circ.

Finally, I went in by hand and wrote down the logic expressions for each 
output, and I also simplified them slightly. Here are my results (copied 
straight out of my Verilog implementation):
    
    //(~inj_vld && out_rdy) means the slave is ready to receive a flit from the
    //master. OR'ing this with drop means the slave (and injector) cannot 
    //backpressure the master if drop is high.
    //
    //(log_rdy || ~log_en) means that the logger is not backpressuring the
    //master
    //
    //Finally, in_rd is forced low if we are paused
    assign in_rdy = ~pause && (log_rdy || ~log_en) && (drop || (~inj_vld && out_rdy));
    
    //If the injector has valid data, it takes precedence
    //The other condition means that the master is trying to send something to
    //the slave, and that the logger is not backpressuring the master
    assign out_vld = inj_vld || (in_vld && ~drop && ~pause && (~log_en || log_rdy));
    
    //Note: this next line is written this way to let Vivado synthesize the logic
    //in simple LUTs. However, it is better understood as
    //
    //assign log_vld = log_en && in_vld && m_rdy;
    //
    //Also note that log_vld depends on log_rdy. Technically, this violates the
    //AXI Stream specification. In order for this to work, you need to connect
    //the log AXI Stream channel to a core which does not have a combinational
    //path from ready to valid (a register slice, for example)
    assign log_vld = log_en && ~pause && in_vld && (drop || (~inj_vld && out_rdy));
    
    //At least this is simple...
    assign inj_rdy = out_rdy;

The next section talks about how I verified this circuit (informally) and that 
my logic expressions correctly matched my diagram.

===========================
HOW DO WE KNOW IF IT WORKS?
===========================

Once I drew up the circuit in Logisim, I asked Logisim to produce a truth table 
for the circuit (Project -> Analyze Circuit). I then pasted this table directly 
into a spreadsheet.

Then, I came up with a list of errors. If any of these errors occur on any line 
of the truth table, the circuit would have to be reviewed:

-> badeat: Alex thinks a flit was consumed, but the governor was paused

-> missdrop: Governor was dropping, but Brittany received a flit (and nothing 
   was injected)

-> wrongdrop: Alex thinks a flit was consumed, but Brittany did not receive 
   anything, and the governor was not dropping

-> badlog: The Logger read something, but (logging was off OR Alex did not send 
   anything)

-> logcopy (special case of badlog): The Logger read something, but Alex did 
   not send anything.

-> slvcopy: Brittany read something, but neither Alex nor the injector sent 
   anything

-> misslog: Alex sent something, logging was on, but the logger did not read 
   anything

-> missout: Brittany did not read anything, but ((Alex sent something AND we 
   weren't paused AND we're not dropping) OR (the injector sent something))

-> missinject (special case of missout): the injector send something but 
   Brittany didn't read anything

-> injectclobber: Alex sent something, we're not paused, we're not dropping, 
   AND the injector sent something.

-> badpause: Alex sent something, but we're paused

-> wronginject: This turned out to be identical to missinject. I've just left 
   the description in here to better explain the attached spreadsheets
   
I have no formal proof that these are all the errors that could happen, but I 
can't think of any more, so that's good enough for me.

By the way, the size of the truth table outputs is 128 by 4, or 512 cells. In 
theory, for me to formally prove correctness, I would have to come up with a 
formal specification for each of the output cells (either 1, 0, or Don't Care). 
I decided not to do that. Who knows, maybe the above method is a more efficient 
way of doing just that?

EXPLANATION OF THE ATTACHED FILES AND SPREADSHEETS
--------------------------------------------------

First of all, notice that there is a gov.circ, gov2.circ, and gov3.circ in 
early_attempts/. These were the attempts I did by just trying to draw the 
circuit without really thinking about it in a structured way. In other words, 
this whole discussion about combining the pause, drop, log, and inject 
primitives (taking care of precedence) didn't occur to me until I had tried to 
make the circuit twice and found errors.

The first three sheets in the spreadsheet show the truth tables for my first 
three attempts. The fourth one shows the final circuit that passed all my tests.

The fifth spreadsheet was how I confirmed to myself that I had correctly 
transcribed the logical formulas from the diagram. The truth table is the same 
one from the correct circuit.

In all the spreadsheets, immediately to the right of the (nicely coloured) 
truth table, are little helper signals for each of the four AXI Streams. They 
are simply the AND of valid and ready, indicating (perceived) flit 
transmission.
