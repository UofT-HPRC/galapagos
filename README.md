# Galapagos Hardware Stack 

Welcome to the Galapagos Hardware Stack. 

## Prerequisites

Both the Docker Container and native install requires Xilinx Vivado to be installed. Current versions supported are 2017.4, 2018.1, 2018.2, 2018.3


## Docker Jupyter Tutorial

To run tutorial refer to instructions in [this README](https://github.com/UofT-HPRC/galapagos/blob/master/docker/README.md)


## Initial Setup for Native Install


First you need to initialize all environment variables. This is done with a build script.
`source build.sh`

The layers of the stack that we introduce are as follows:

- Middleware Layer
- Hypervisor Layer
- Physical Hardware /Network Setup

For more details on our automation process please refer to the Makefile. 

## Physical Hardware/Network Setup Layer

Our setup has all FPGAs connected directly to a network switch.  We have the following FPGA boards:
- Alphadata 7v3
- Alphadata 8k5
- Alphadata 8v3
- Fidus Sidewinder (also has a hardened ARM CPU)

Boards without the hardened ARM are connected with an X86 CPU via PCIe. 

## Hypervisor Layer

We plan to have hypervisors setup for various boards. Currently the hypervisor abstracts away the network and PCIe interfaces. 
This exposes all devices with a hypervisor as an AXI-stream in and out through the network interface, and an S_AXI interface from PCIe or ARM and M_AXI to off-chip memory


## Middleware Layer

This takes two files (refer to LOGICALFILE, MAPFILE defined in the Makefile) and partitions a large cluster logically described by the user into multiple separate FPGAs.

### LOGICALFILE

The cluster is described in a LOGICALFILE with no notion of the mappings. 
The following is an example kernel from the logical file:
```
 <kernel> kernelName
	<num> 1 </num>
        <rep> 1 </rep>
        <clk> nameOfClockPort </clk>
        <id_port> nameOfIDport </id_port>
        <aresetn> nameOfResetPort </aresetn>
        <s_axis>
            <name> nameOfInputStreamInterface </name>
	    <scope> scope </scope>
        </s_axis>
        <m_axis>
            <name> nameOfOutputStreamInterface </name>
	    <scope> scope </scope>
            <debug/>
        </m_axis>
        <s_axi>
            <name> nameofControlInterface </name>
	    <scope> scope </scope>
        </s_axi>
        <m_axi>
            <name> nameOfMemoryInterface </name>
	    <scope> scope </scope>
        </m_axi>
</kernel>
```

The `<num>` tag refers to the unique ID of a kernel. <br/>
The `<rep>` refers to the number of times to repeat a kernel. The IDs are of repeated kernels are increased sequentially. <br/>
The `<clk>` refers to the name of the clock interface, this will be tied to the clock in the Hypervisor. <br/
The `<aresetn>` refers to the name of the reset interface, this will be tied to the clock in the Hypervisor (negative edge triggered). <br/>
The `<id_port>` refers to the port name in the kernel that will be tied to a constant with the value of the unique kernel ID. (optional) <br/>
The `<s_axi>` refers to a port from that would be of the `s_axi` interface. If the scope is `global` then this will connect to the control interface (can be either PCIe or ARM, depending on the board). For a local scope, you can specify the `master` which would be another `m_axi` interface that is of `local` scope. <br/>
The `<m_axi>` refers to a port that would be of the `m_axi` interface. If it's of `global` scope then it will tie to the off-chip memory, else it will connect to an `s_axi` interface that is of `local` scope. <br/>
The `<s_axis>` and `<m_axis>` is similar to that of the above interfaces, except that is is the AXI stream. `global` scope ties to the networking port, `local` can connect to each other. <br/>


### MAPFILE

The cluster is described in a MAPFILE with no notion of the mappings.  <br/>
The following is an example kernel from the map file:

```
<node>
        <board> adm-8k5-debug </board>
        <comm> eth </comm>
        <type> hw </type>
        <kernel> 1 </kernel>
        <kernel> 2 </kernel>
        <kernel> 3 </kernel>
        <mac_addr>  fa:16:3e:55:ca:02 </mac_addr>
        <ip_addr> 10.1.2.102 </ip_addr>
</node>

```

The `<board>` tag refers to the FPGA board you wish to use for this particular node. <br/>
The `<kernel>` refers to the unique kernel ID that you wish to put on this node.  <br/>
